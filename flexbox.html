            <div id="message1" class="message">My first impressions of "holiness" come from my childhood memories of church and are associated with my pastor's
                wife, one of the most influential people of my life, although she and her husband resigned the pastorate
                when I was only eleven. My pastor's wife, Ruth Beauford, had been a schoolteacher. She was a picture of properness.
                Of her appearance I remember most her white hair, penetrating eyes, set jaw, and straightness of back. Across
                the front of our church's platform was a rock planter open only at the ends. At the right far end of the
                planter, on the women's altar side, Sis. Beauford often knelt to pray. I see her even now in my mind's eye
                kneeling there with back straight as a ramrod, tears running out of tightly clenched shut eyes, and hands
                half raised palms open upwards. I hear her with a sort of singsong voice crying, but not loudly, "Holy, holy,
                holy. Holy, holy, holy," seemingly lost to all around her. This is a child's impression. I don't know how
                often she prayed exactly there and in exactly that way, but whenever I think of her praying, this picture
                immediately comes to mind. As she so prayed, I knew God's presence was real. I could feel it. Though I could
                not have put it in words as a child, I sensed in her worship that God was transcendent: God is beyond all
                that is finite, temporal, material. There is none like Him, compared to Him, besides Him. He is the Other.
                He is holy. Yet, at the same time I gathered that, although He was transcendent, He was descendent. He came
                down. He visited us. We could experience Him. Try it today. Sincerely focus on Him and cry, "Holy, holy,
                holy." He that is beyond will come to you.

            <div class="message">There is another occasion that I remember Sis. Beauford, my childhood pastor's wife, crying "Holy, holy, holy."
                It happened in our junior boys Sunday School class. For some reason we had moved to a new room which was
                upstairs in the gable above the entrance to the church. Our teacher was a big, strong, likeable man known
                for his strength, boxing, and love for God. Yet, he was having trouble controlling us boys. We were rowdy
                and loud. As we were cutting up, I, being seated with my back mostly towards the door, suddenly felt a fearful
                chill go all over me. All the boys in a moment were as quiet as an empty room. Half turning, I saw Sis. Beauford
                standing there. She had entered unbeknownst to us. She was standing there back straight, Bible clasped to
                her chest just under her chin, and saying, "Holy, holy, holy." Each of us boys was quaking. Not from the
                fear of a cruel person, but from the fear of having violated a holy place with unholy, unjustifiable behavior.
                Once she had our attention, Sis. Beauford then began to calmly but so firmly tell us why our behavior was
                unacceptable. I didn't feel like we had offended her, or offended our teacher with our disrespectful acts,
                but I felt we had offended God-grieved God. There was a time when people feared God. It wasn't a fear that
                made God repulsive or dreaded. It was a fear that made Him loved, desired, hungered after. Our society is
                in a great mess. Much of the mess can arguably be traced to the Church's expunging from its worship and teaching
                any emphasis on the holiness of God. God is no longer feared. When God is not feared, any and every behavior
                will be ultimately be accepted. Our nation has more wrong with it than rowdy, junior boys. It desperately
                needs to hear the church passionately say of God, "Holy, holy, holy." That would begin to make as much difference
                as Sis. Beauford in the junior boys Sunday School class.
