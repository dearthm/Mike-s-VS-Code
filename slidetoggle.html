<div id="title">Holy, Holy, Holy</div>There is another occasion that I remember Sis. Beauford, my childhood pastor's wife, crying "Holy, holy, holy."
                It happened in our junior boys Sunday School class. For some reason we had moved to a new room which was
                upstairs in the gable above the entrance to the church. Our teacher was a big, strong, likeable man known
                for his strength, boxing, and love for God. Yet, he was having trouble controlling us boys. We were rowdy
                and loud. As we were cutting up, I, being seated with my back mostly towards the door, suddenly felt a fearful
                chill go all over me. All the boys in a moment were as quiet as an empty room. Half turning, I saw Sis. Beauford
                standing there. She had entered unbeknownst to us. She was standing there back straight, Bible clasped to
                her chest just under her chin, and saying, "Holy, holy, holy." Each of us boys was quaking. Not from the
                fear of a cruel person, but from the fear of having violated a holy place with unholy, unjustifiable behavior.
                Once she had our attention, Sis. Beauford then began to calmly but so firmly tell us why our behavior was
                unacceptable. I didn't feel like we had offended her, or offended our teacher with our disrespectful acts,
                but I felt we had offended God-grieved God. There was a time when people feared God. It wasn't a fear that
                made God repulsive or dreaded. It was a fear that made Him loved, desired, hungered after. Our society is
                in a great mess. Much of the mess can arguably be traced to the Church's expunging from its worship and teaching
                any emphasis on the holiness of God. God is no longer feared. When God is not feared, any and every behavior
                will be ultimately be accepted. Our nation has more wrong with it than rowdy, junior boys. It desperately
                needs to hear the church passionately say of God, "Holy, holy, holy." That would begin to make as much difference
                as Sis. Beauford in the junior boys Sunday School class.</div>
